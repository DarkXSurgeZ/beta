# Version 0.1.1

> This release is a minor bugfix for the much larger changes in [v0.1.0](./v0_1_0.md)
> You can download this release from [GitHub now](https://github.com/silveredgold/beta-protection/releases/tag/v0.1.1)

I strongly recommend you read the [ugprade notes for v0.1.0](./v0_1_0.md) since they include a lot of changes you should know about, as well as important information for upgrading/installing.

This bugfix just includes some fixes for the Beta Safety support, namely fixing sticker selection support and placeholder import. Thanks to Jesse for letting me know about these issues.

Even if you've been using Beta Protection before now, I'd **strongly** recommend checking out the new [user guide](https://silveredgold.github.io/beta-protection/guide/usage.html).

## Installation Guide

As always, check out the [Getting Started guide](https://silveredgold.github.io/beta-protection/getting-started) or the [Installation guide](https://silveredgold.github.io/beta-protection/guide/installation.html) for all the details on installing Beta Protection and getting set up.
