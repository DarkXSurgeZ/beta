title: v0.1.2 Release Notes
---

# Version 0.1.2

> This release is a minor bugfix for the much larger changes in [v0.1.0](./v0_1_0.md)
> You can download this release from [GitHub now](https://github.com/silveredgold/beta-protection/releases/tag/v0.1.1)

I strongly recommend you read the [ugprade notes for v0.1.0](./v0_1_0.md) since they include a lot of changes you should know about, as well as important information for upgrading/installing.

This release includes some small but useful changes: option to manually refresh available stickers (from any backend), fixes for local censoring of whole directories, and the options to enable subliminals even when censoring isn't enabled.

Thanks to the users who reported/requested these updates!

Even if you've been using Beta Protection before now, I'd **strongly** recommend checking out the new [user guide](https://silveredgold.github.io/beta-protection/guide/usage.html).

## Installation Guide

As always, check out the [Getting Started guide](https://silveredgold.github.io/beta-protection/getting-started) or the [Installation guide](https://silveredgold.github.io/beta-protection/guide/installation.html) for all the details on installing Beta Protection and getting set up.
