# Beta Protection

A Chrome extension companion to the Beta Safety app, censoring NSFW images as you view them.

This site includes the documentation required to get started with the extension as well as some more background information on the extension and how it's built.

To get started with Beta Protection, use the links on the left to navigate the guide. While these docs are kind of barebones, they will be expanded over time.

> These docs are also open-source, so [contributions are always welcome](https://github.com/silveredgold/beta-protection).
