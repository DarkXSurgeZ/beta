For convenience, we have included automated scripts to whitelist Beta Protection&#39;s extension ID for Chrome, Edge and Brave. Download the <code>whitelisting.zip</code> file from the release (where you downloaded the CRX file) and unzip it somewhere. Find the <code>.reg</code> file for your browser and double click it.</p><p>This will add a key to your registry with Beta Protection&#39;s ID that tells the browser you trust it. If you want to confirm that, right-click the <code>.reg</code> file and click Edit to see what changes it will make.</p><h3 id="installing-the-extension-unpacked" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#installing-the-extension-unpacked" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Installing the extension unpacked</h3><p>If you are having trouble with installing the CRX or don&#39;t want to whitelist Beta Protection, the easiest way to get started is to load the extension &quot;unpacked&quot; (this is how Beta Safety installs, if you&#39;re more familiar with that).</p><p><img src="'+c+'" width="200"></p><ol><li>Download the <code>beta-protection-...</code> ZIP file from the GitHub Releases page (rather than the <code>.crx</code> file), and extract it somewhere</li><li>From your browser&#39;s Manage Extensions page (with Developer Mode on), find the <em>Load Unpacked</em> option</li><li>Click it, and select the folder where you unpacked the ZIP file.

In the interest of transparency, here&#39;s a rundown of the permissions requested and they&#39;re used for:</p><ul><li><code>activeTab</code>: Requred to manipulate the active tab, to replace images on the page with placeholders and censored images</li><li><code>contextMenus</code>:As the name implies, required to show the Beta Protection context menus</li><li><code>storage</code>: Required to access Chrome&#39;s extension storage, used to store your extension preferences mostly.</li><li><code>scripting</code>: Chrome requires this permission so we can inject styles and scripts into tabs. This is used for two things: <ul><li>Styling: Since page lifecycles are complicated, the short version is that we add some global CSS styles to hide uncensored images while we process them</li><li>Subliminals: If you have subliminal messages enabled, the styles and logic for them are injected into each tab</li></ul></li><li><code>notifications</code>: Only used for the update checker, to notify you when there&#39;s an update available, or for breaking changes. This is needed since Chrome only auto-updates extensions from the Chrome Web Store, not locally installed ones.</li><li><code>alarms</code>: Due to changes in the Chrome extension API, this is now the only way to reliably perform tasks on a regular basis, so Beta Protection uses them for a few &quot;utility&quot; tasks.</li></ul>',25),U=t("As always, if you're worried about what Beta Protection is doing or how it works, you can always check the full source "),J={href:"https://github.com/silveredgold/beta-protection",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},K=t("on GitHub"),Q=t(".");function $(ee,te){const o=i("ExternalLinkIcon");return a(),s(r,null,[p,f,e("p",null,[g,m,b,w,_,e("a",y,[x,n(o)]),k]),v,B,C,e("p",null,[P,e("a",I,[S,n(o)]),q,e("a",E,[D,n(o)]),F]),R,A,T,W,e("p",null,[z,e("a",Y,[j,n(o)]),G,M,V,X,H]),e("blockquote",null,[e("p",null,[N,e("a",L,[O,n(o)])])]),Z,e("blockquote",null,[e("p",null,[U,e("a",J,[K,n(o)]),Q])])],64)}var ie=h(u,[["render",$]]);export{ie as default};
