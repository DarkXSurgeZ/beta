# Beta Protection

A Chrome extension companion to the Beta Safety app, censoring NSFW images as you view them.

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Load extension from the `dist/` folder

If you want to work on it live, run `npm run serve` instead, then load from the `dist/` directory as usual. The project will rebuild on changes, and Webpack will hot reload the extension in your browser.
